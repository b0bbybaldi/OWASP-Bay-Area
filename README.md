You can find the presentation at [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n3NigZdb0HNGPXDpIivem8T4gmo7LueHUvr62qjlQrg/edit?usp=sharing).


## Preparation
In order to be able to participate, we recommend that you:
- Install docker on your laptop
- Have Python 3 and pip3 (Todo: Install instructions) installed on your laptop when running MacOS X
- Optionally: have iOS with a jailbreak installed to play around during iOS demos
- Install android 7 and Android 8 emulators (see android folder)
- Install objection and BurpSuite (community edition)

## Android

in the android folder, you can find 2 large zip files of emulators. Next you can find the scripts to generate them yourself (e.g. create_root_emu<androidversion>.sh). See the README.md for more details.
